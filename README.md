# URL Shortening App
- #### Python Version 3.9
- #### Using VirtualEnv for dev environment
- #### Bootstrap v4 for Styling

This app was built to test out the Flask framework for Python.

Basic authentication and authorization were used with a local SQLite database.

To deploy, you will need to create an SQLite database called __urls.db__ in the root directory.

Virtual Environment must have __Flask__ installed but no other libraries were used outside of the standard Python library.
